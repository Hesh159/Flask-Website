# Flask-Website
Full stack website for an online store using Flask for the backend. This was done as a college project. The professor allowed us to choose our own topic so I decided on a store dedicated to selling made up alcohol. I went a bit overboard with the jokes but thankfully my professor saw the humour. I recieved a grade of 98% for the project.
